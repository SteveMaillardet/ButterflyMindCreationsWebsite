                <div>
                    <p>First of all, why 'Butterfly Mind'? Well, when I was little my Dad always said I had a butterfly mind because I could never concentrate on one thing or stay still for very long. I was always on the go, got bored easily and chopped and changed from one activity to another or from one thought to the next, just like a butterfly going from flower to flower. That was when I was young, not much has changed! Apart from the fact that I am much older and a bit slower, but certainly my thoughts leap around with no 'mirror, signal, manoeuvre' warning for anyone trying to follow.

                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>I am passionate about:-</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>my family</li>
                            <li>spreading God's word in a fun, interactive way
                            helping children who struggle with school and schools who struggle with some children</li>
                            <li>being creative in all I do</li>    
                        </ul>            
                </div>

    
                <div>
                So, what do I do?
                    <ul>
                    I am:-
                        <li>a mother of three gorgeous children - mostly grown up now </li>
                        <li>a wife of a very long suffering and patient husband</li> 
                        <li>a Christian who doesn't like being too religious </li>
                        <li>a teacher by profession, although I don't  teach at the moment</li>
                        <li>a crafter who is a 'jack of all trades and master of none' because I have had a go at so many things over the years, but never patient enough to stick with anything to get any good at it </li>
                        <li>dancer when no one is looking and a singer when no one is listening. </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                
                <div>
                    <p>I have been thinking for some time that I would like to have a go at writing a blog. Just somewhere to put my ideas and thoughts and some of the things I create. I do this for myself, but if anyone else reads it and it helps in any way, then that's good. Anyway, here it is...
